# Tennis Admin System - Task Completion Summary

## 🎯 Tasks Completed

### Task 1: ✅ Translate English Text to Chinese
All English text in the admin system has been translated to Chinese:

#### Login Page (Login.vue)
- Form validation messages: "Please enter your email" → "请输入邮箱地址"
- Error messages: "Login failed" → "登录失败"
- Status messages: "Waking up server..." → "正在唤醒服务器..."
- Success message: "Login successful!" → "登录成功！"

#### Sidebar Navigation (AdminSidebar.vue)
- "Dashboard" → "管理面板"
- "User Management" → "用户管理"
- "Event Management" → "赛事管理"
- "Statistics" → "统计数据"
- "User Stats" → "用户统计"
- "Event Stats" → "赛事统计"
- "System" → "系统管理"
- "Settings" → "系统设置"
- "Audit Logs" → "审计日志"

#### Header Component (AdminHeader.vue)
- "Tennis Admin" → "网球管理系统"
- "Profile" → "个人资料"
- "Settings" → "设置"
- "Logout" → "退出登录"
- Confirmation dialogs and messages translated

### Task 2: ✅ Fixed 404 API Errors
The 404 errors were caused by the frontend trying to connect to the production server instead of the local development server.

#### Root Cause
- Frontend was configured to use: `https://zero729-wxapp-tennis.onrender.com/api`
- Local backend was running on: `http://localhost:3000/api`

#### Solution
- Updated `tennis-admin/.env` file to point to local backend:
  ```
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
  ```

#### API Endpoints Verified Working
- ✅ `/api/admin/stats/overview` - Returns user and event statistics
- ✅ `/api/admin/stats/activity` - Returns recent activity data
- ✅ `/api/admin/stats/users` - Returns user statistics
- ✅ `/api/admin/stats/events` - Returns event statistics
- ✅ Authentication working with JWT tokens

### Task 3: ✅ Fixed Dashboard Showing 0 Users/Events
The dashboard was showing 0 users and 0 events because there was insufficient test data in the database.

#### Solution
1. **Created Test Data Script**: `backend/fix-indexes-and-create-data.js`
2. **Fixed Database Index Issues**: Removed problematic legacy indexes that were causing duplicate key errors
3. **Added Test Data**:
   - **11 total users** (10 active users + 1 admin)
   - **10 total events** (9 published events + 1 ongoing)
   - Diverse user data with different skill levels and regions
   - Various event types and statuses

#### Current Database State
```
📊 Final data:
   - Total users: 11 (10 active)
   - Total events: 10 (9 published)
```
